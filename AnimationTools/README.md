# Animation Tools
## Animation splitter
(No coding required)
As playCanvas creates one animation per fbx file, AnimationSplitter can split that animation to several animations based on time and each animation could be used separately.
The animations will be available on your animation component and can be accessed using play(animationName).

##AnimationEditTools
Use the function removeInterpolation(boneName) to make the animation as constant interpolation
